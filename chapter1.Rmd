**Question 2**
*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here.*

Hello, I would describe this course a crash course for individuals who are interested in learning about the possibilities of open science, open data, and open research tools such as *RStudio* and *GitHub*. I am one of such persons and very much exited to be part of it. Even though I am new to RStudio, I am not new to programming and with the idea of adding the R coding language to my programming toolbox, I feel will make me more versatile as a researcher and data analyst. I heard about this course from the weekly emails sent to students from Faculty of Social Studies (HYMY). I can now show my progress and my knowledge in R based on what I do from  [here](https://github.com/kobbyababio/IODS-project.git)
